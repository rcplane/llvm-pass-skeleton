## Implementation

- We adapted the code from [here](https://www.zzzconsulting.se/2018/07/16/llvm-exercise.html#experiment) to develop a rudimentary `mem2reg` pass that promotes stack slots to variables. Specifically, many compiler frontends emit LLVM IR emulating mutation by reading and writing to a stack
slot standing in for a temporary. This is technically SSA because, although it mutates memory, it does not reassign any variable.
- An `alloca` instruction stands in for a temporary if it only uses are stores; this ensures that no other memory location aliases it.
- After collecting all of the `alloca` instructions which stand in for temporaries, we then perform phi insertion to insert phi nodes for the
`alloca` to be converted into a temporary. We treat the initial set of defining blocks for an `alloca` as the set of blocks that write to that location, and use LLVM's `ForwardIDFCalculator` to compute the dominance frontier; we then insert phi nodes into these blocks.
- We then proceed with the renaming step of SSA conversion, which is simplified by the fact that the code is already in SSA; stacks of varaible names are replaced by stacks of values stored to a stack slot. For example, when we encounter `store data, loc`, where `loc` is known to be an `alloca`, we push `data` onto the stack of definitions for `loc`. Then, when we encounter `x = load loc`, where `loc` is known to be an `alloca`, we replace all uses of `x` with the top of the definitions stack for `loc`.
